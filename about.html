            Hello,
My Name is <b>Sani Abubakar Haruna</b> "I am a passionate programmer with a deep love for solving complex problems through elegant code. With a background in computer science and several years of professional experience, I started coding since from 2022 till date and I have honed my skills in various programming languages, including HTML, CSS,  JavaScript etc.
          </p>
          <p class="dark">
From developing efficient algorithms to creating user-friendly interfaces, I thrive on turning innovative ideas into functional software. I am a strong advocate for clean, maintainable code and enjoy collaborating with cross-functional teams to bring projects to life.
When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring the latest developments in the tech world or contributing to open-source projects that align with my interests."

          <h3>6 REASONS WHY I'M LEARNING TO CODE AND YOU SHOULD TOO‼️</h3>
            <p>
                

Before I give you my 6 reasons, I just want to say that I am a beginner when it comes to coding and it is something that I plan to use as a career choice. <br>

It is something that's probably going to be involved in my life forever and the whole point of this post is just to draw you closer and let you know that we can all learn code and live happily ever. <br> <br>

1. You do not need BACHELOR'S degree to be a programmer. Also, you can be hired without presenting a certificate. <br> <br>

2. You're more likely to get a job: There are over four million job openings right now that require coding skills. How cool is that? <br> <br>

3. Technology runs the world: Social media, websites and a lot of other things were built by programmers with code. <br> <br>

4. A lot of times, software engineers and developers work from home. I just like the idea of waking up, getting on my computer doing some codes and then that's it.

I believe you know that there's more to it obviously but I'm saying like you work less hours and earn bigger. <br> <br>

5. You get a lot of career options: Just search Google for different code related careers and you're going to see more than enough. More interestingly, most of them are even related.

Web development, web designing, software engineering, mobile app development, game apps are just few of many.
Coding is almost like the routes to technology that we use today. <br> <br>

6. You feel so proud of yourself and accomplished for completing a simple task

As a web designer, my primary focus is on creating visually appealing and user-friendly websites. I blend creativity with technical expertise to design and develop interfaces that not only captivate users but also ensure a seamless and intuitive navigation experience. My role involves understanding client requirements, incorporating branding elements, and staying updated on design trends to produce modern and aesthetically pleasing websites. From wireframing and prototyping to implementing responsive designs, I strive to enhance the overall user experience across various devices. Additionally, I collaborate closely with clients, developers, and other stakeholders to ensure that the final product aligns with both design expectations and functional requirements. My goal is to not only craft visually engaging websites but also contribute to the effectiveness and success of the online presence for individuals and businesses alike.
